V0.4.0 Support for KSP 1.1.x
RE-factored code to remove need for KKInterfaces.dll and AYInterfaces.dll. Now uses Reflection to communicate between KabinKraziness and AmpYear.
V0.3.2 Support for KSP 1.0.5
V0.3.1 Support for KSP 1.0.3
V0.3 Converted Kevin to Celsius in the temperature displays for command pods. Added KSP-AVC support.
V0.2 Recompile for KSP V1.0.0
V0.1a Fixed dependency with AmpYear. Moved AmpYear and KabinKraziness to shared folder in /gamedata/REPOSoftTech.
V0.1 Removed KabinKraziness from AmpYear and made it separate option implementation (hence this OP).
