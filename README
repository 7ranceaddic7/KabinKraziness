Kabin Kraziness - 
A modifier attached to crew-able parts. The KabinKraziness goes up over time based on how much space the crew have, 
how far from Kerbin you are and if your Cabin temperature is within 5 degrees of the climate control setting. 

Dependancies:-
this Mod Requires ModuleManager and AmpYear to be installed or it will not function.
See the KSP Forum for details of installation.

- There are two levels of Kraziness Alert - Minor and Major (configurable via settings menu on Space center screen).
Once these levels are reached random events may occur where the crew may:-
- Disable Autopilot functions for a period of time (cumulative).
- Throw out (dump) some resources.
- Throw out (dump) some science experiments.
- A crew member may randomly decide to go on EVA.

Luxury Fitted Command Pods
- Yes all command pods now come with Klimate Kontrol, Jazz music and Massage chairs. 
These items reduce KabinKraziness (see below), consume electricity and makes missions more pleasant for the crew.
- The Klimate Kontrol function maintains the cabin temperature to a pre-set value, and the cabin temp can be viewed 
through the command pod right click menu. If turned off Cabin Temperature will slowly change towards the outside 
ambient temperature having a negative effect on KabinKraziness.
The Klimate Kontrol, Jazz Music Radio and Massage Chairs reduce KabinKraziness over time at the cost of electriccharge.

KabinKraziness will Hibernate at high time warp settings (can't be avoided due to issues with electric charge in KSP
at high rates of warp).
